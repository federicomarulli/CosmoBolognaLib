Read INSTALL for instructions on compilation.

Documentation on mangle is at

http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/mangle/

To get started, try creating the mask for an example slice of the SDSS survey:
cd <mangle_directory>/masks/sdss
and follow the README, 
or follow the QuickStart section on the website.

Typing a command with no arguments will give you a brief summary of its usage. 

Typing a command with the -d switch will tell you what the defaults are.

The mathematical algorithms are described by
Hamilton A J S & Tegmark M (2004)
"A scheme to deal accurately and efficiently with complex angular masks
in galaxy surveys", MNRAS, 349, 115-128
and 
Swanson M E C, Tegmark M, Hamilton A J S, and Hill J C (2008)
"Methods for rapidly processing angular masks of next-generation galaxy 
surveys", MNRAS, 387, 1391-1402.

The intention is that the probability of the mangle software failing,
once successfully compiled, should be comparable to the probability
of a piece of spacejunk falling on your head (let's hope it ain't true).
If it fails, please check out Troubleshooting at
http://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/mangle/manual/troubleshooting.html
If you still have a problem, please contact the mangle development team via
Andrew.Hamilton@colorado.edu or tegmark@mit.edu
