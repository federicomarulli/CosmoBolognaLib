The mangle software is written in c and fortran,
so to compile mangle you will need both c and fortran compilers.

To (re)compile
--------------

cd <mangle_directory>/src
make

The executables will be in
<mangle_directory>/bin

To remove unneeded object files
-------------------------------

cd <mangle_directory>/src
make clean

To remove a previous compilation and compile from scratch
---------------------------------------------------------

cd <mangle_directory>/src
make cleanest
make

To generate a new Makefile for your local system and then compile from scratch
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cd <mangle_directory>/src
configure
make cleanest
make


To compile a statically linked version suitable for distribution
----------------------------------------------------------------

cd <mangle_directory>/src
make cleanest
make static

Systems on which mangle 2.x has compiled successfully
-----------------------------------------------------

real*10 version:
Linux
 gcc
 gfortran 4.1.x or later

Mac OSX Intel
 gcc
 gfortran 4.1.x or later

see http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/GFortranBinaries for gfortran for Mac OSX
may require updated version of cctools from ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/

real*8 version:
Linux
 gcc
 g77

Mac OSX Intel and PowerPC
 gcc
 g77

Systems on which mangle1.x has compiled successfully
----------------------------------------------------

Linux
 gcc versions 2 or 3
 g77 or fort77

Solaris
 cc or gcc
 f77 or g77

To patch mangle1.4 to mangle1.4.1
---------------------------------
cd <mangle_directory>
patch -p1 < ../path.to.the/mangle1.4_to_1.4.1.patch

You will then need to recompile.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If the Makefile gives problems, try using gmake (the gnu version of make)
in place of make.  More generally, mangle is known to compile and run
successfully with the gnu versions gcc and g77 of the c and fortran compilers,
and with the gnu version gmake of the make command.
To compile the real*10 version, you will need a compiler that supports real*10,
for example, gfortran version 4.1 or later (though not all distributions
of gfortran support real*10).  


There are bound to be problems with compilation in early stages of the general
release of mangle, since mangle has been tested only on a limited number of
systems.  If you are having problems compiling, please contact the mangle development 
team via Andrew.Hamilton@colorado.edu or tegmark@mit.edu, and we will try to work
with you to get mangle to compile on your system.
